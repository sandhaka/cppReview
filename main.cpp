     * NOTE: "Why not just create a separate class?"
     * Why specialization is useful if it's a complete new entity?
     * Can sound better just to have another class or template class? Why I should use specialization?
     *
     * Template specialization allows you to tie "special cases to general cases" in a way that makes sense semantically.
     * Even if a specialized class is treated as a "completely new entity," youâ€™re still signaling,
     * "This is a variant of the same concept."
     *
     * It keeps everything logically grouped together, making the intent clear that "special cases are still part of the same broader idea."
     * If you create an entirely new class (not related by templates), you lose this organizational and conceptual link.
     * This can make the code harder to understand or maintain.
